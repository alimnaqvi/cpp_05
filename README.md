# C++ Module 05: Repetition and Exceptions

This project is part of the curriculum at 42 school.

Core concepts learned and applied:
- Exercise 00:
  - Try, except blocks
  - Exception classes
  - Aborting object construction by throwing exception in the constructor body
  - std::exception and deriving own classes from it
- Exercise 02:
  - Further practicing and deepening understanding of abstract classes, inheritance, virtual functions, file I/O, and DRY principle
  - ASCII art!
  - Randomizing function outcome (PRNGs, seeding, Mersenne Twister 19937 generator, etc.)
